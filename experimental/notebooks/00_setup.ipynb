    "Hello and a massive, enthusiastic **WELCOME** to everyone joining us today! We are absolutely thrilled to have you here in sunny San Diego for what promises to be an exciting hands-on session at Tableau Conference 2025! üéâ\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the next little while, we're going to embark on a fantastic journey together, exploring the powerful intersection of **Tableau** and cutting-edge **AI frameworks like Langchain and LangGraph**. Our goal? To show you how you can build intelligent agents capable of interacting with your Tableau environment, querying data sources, and even integrating with other tools like Slack!\n",
    "\n",
    "Get ready to roll up your sleeves and dive into the code. We'll be using **Jupyter Notebooks** (like this one!) which allow us to blend explanations with runnable Python code, making for a truly interactive learning experience. We anticipate you'll be interacting with these notebooks primarily through a Jupyter interface (like JupyterLab, classic Notebook, or VS Code's integrated Jupyter tools).\n",
    "\n",
    "We've designed this session to be practical, insightful, and hopefully, a lot of fun! Let's get started by making sure everyone's development environment is ready to go! üëá"

    "\n",
    "If you are using the Virtual Machine specifically set up for this workshop ‚Äì fantastic! You're likely already set up. The VM should have all the necessary software and Python packages pre-installed. You can probably skip straight to **Step 2: Clone the Workshop Repository**!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option B: Setting Up Your Local Machine (If *Not* Using the VM) üíª\n",
    "\n",
    "No worries if you would rather work directly on your own machine! We just need to make sure you have the required tools and libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Python:** Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.8 or newer is recommended). You can check by opening a terminal or command prompt and typing `python --version` or `python3 --version`. If you need to install it, visit [python.org](https://www.python.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Git:** We need Git to download the workshop materials. Check if it's installed by typing `git --version` in your terminal. If not, download it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Create a Python Virtual Environment (Highly Recommended!):**\n",
    "   To avoid conflicts with other Python projects on your system, we *strongly* recommend creating and activating a dedicated virtual environment for this workshop. Open your terminal in the directory where you plan to clone the repository (or anywhere suitable) and run:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   # Create the virtual environment (e.g., named 'tableau-ai-env')\n",
    "   python3 -m venv tableau-ai-env\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Activate the environment:\n",
    "   # On macOS/Linux:\n",
    "   source tableau-ai-env/bin/activate\n",
    "   # On Windows:\n",
    "   .\\tableau-ai-env\\Scripts\\activate\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   \n",
    "   You should see the environment name (e.g., (tableau-ai-env)) appear at the beginning of your terminal prompt, indicating it's active. Remember to activate this environment every time you work on the workshop in a new terminal session.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Install Required Python Packages:**\n",
    "   With your virtual environment activated, run the following command to install the core libraries we'll be using:\n",
    "\n",
    "      ```bash\n",
    "   pip install langchain langchain-openai langgraph python-dotenv langchain-community slack_sdk jupyter ipython -U\n",

You do *not* need to create your own OpenAI accounts, Tableau Connected Apps, or Slack tokens for this session.** We will provide everything you need!\n",

    "3.  **Create the `.env` File:**\n",
    "    * Go back to your file explorer or your code editor (like VS Code, Sublime Text, Notepad, etc. - any text editor will work!).\n",
    "    * Navigate to the **root directory** of the `tableau_langchain` project you just cloned.\n",
    "    * Create a **new file** exactly named: `.env` (notice the dot at the beginning!).\n",
