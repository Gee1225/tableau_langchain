    "# Part 2: Integrating Tableau for Data Source Q&A\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the second part of our tutorial! In this section, we're going to take our Langchain agent to the next level by integrating it with **Tableau**. Now that you learned how to create an agent using the prebuilt `create_react_agent` in the [first exercise](./01_intro_to_langgraph.ipynb), let's provide this system with a Tableau tool so it can query a datasource and analyze the resulting data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Tableau Data Source Q&A tool** leverages a few powerful Tableau features behind the scenes to make this seamless integration possible:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **VizQL Data Service API**: This is the communication channel our agent will use to request data from your published Tableau data sources. It also provides valuable metadata about the data.\n",
    "2.  **Metadata API**: This API allows the agent to understand the semantics of your data, such as synonyms and descriptions for different fields, often managed through Tableau's Data Catalog.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these capabilities you can equip the agent to surface insights in natural language from the data sources you have diligently built to run your analytics practice with [Tableau Prep](https://www.tableau.com/products/prep) (pictured below).\n",
    "\n",
    "![Tableau Prep](./assets/prep_builder.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This integration offers a fantastic opportunity to amplify the impact of your data analytics work by making your Tableau data accessible and understandable through natural language queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise we will create a **Superstore Agent** that is able to query the [Superstore Datasource](https://help.tableau.com/current/guides/get-started-tutorial/en-us/get-started-tutorial-connect.htm). This is convenient because this data source is available on every [Tableau Cloud](https://www.tableau.com/products/cloud-bi) or [Tableau Server](https://www.tableau.com/products/server) site by default and it also ships with every [Tableau Desktop](https://www.tableau.com/products/desktop) app (so you can republish it if yours was deleted).\n",

    "* **Data Source LUID**: The unique identifier (LUID) of the specific Tableau data source you want the agent to query.\n",
    "* **Language Model (`model`)**: The LLM we initialized in the previous notebook (like `gpt-4o-mini`), which will be used to understand the user's questions and translate them into data queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `datasource_luid` in this case should match the luid provided by your Tableau site for the *Superstore* data source.

As long as our requests align with the guidelines set in the system prompt, we can instruct the LLM to perform a wide variety of tasks with the data it fetches.\n",

    "**2. Translating Data Insights:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we'll leverage the LLM's translation capabilities. We'll ask the agent to fetch some data and then translate the key insights into another language, such as Swedish or French, for one of your international colleagues. This showcases how the agent can bridge language barriers.\n",

    "**3. Creative Data Output:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, let's get creative! We'll craft a prompt that asks the agent to fetch data and then present it in a more imaginative format. This could be a song, a poem, a rap, or any other creative expression the LLM can generate.\n",
