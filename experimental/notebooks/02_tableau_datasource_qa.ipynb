    "This Datasource Q&A tool leverages a few Tableau features to function:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. VizQL Data Service API -> Where the Agent requests data from a published data source and obtains useful metadata\n",
    "2. Metadata API -> How the Agent obtains useful semantics such as synonyms for individual fields via the Data Catalog\n",
    "\n",
    "With these capabilities you can equip the agent to surface insights in natural language from the data sources you have diligently built to run your analytics practice with [Tableau Prep](https://www.tableau.com/products/prep) (shown below).\n",
