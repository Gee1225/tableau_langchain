    "# Tableau Data Source Q&A\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you learned how to create an agent using the prebuilt `create_react_agent` in the [first exercise](./01_intro_to_langgraph.ipynb), let's provide it with a Tableau tool so it can query a datasource and analyze the result. \n",
    "\n",
    "This Datasource Q&A tool leverages a few Tableau features to function:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [VizQL Data Service API](https://help.tableau.com/current/api/vizql-data-service/en-us/index.html) -> Where the Agent requests data from a published data source and obtains useful metadata\n",
    "2. [Metadata API](https://help.tableau.com/current/api/metadata_api/en-us/index.html) -> How the Agent obtains useful semantics such as synonyms for individual fields via the Data Catalog\n",
    "\n",
    "With these capabilities you can equip the agent to surface insights in natural language from the data sources you have diligently built to run your analytics practice with [Tableau Prep](https://www.tableau.com/products/prep) (pictured below).\n",
    "\n",
    "![Tableau Prep](./assets/prep_builder.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the perfect way to maximize the impact of your work with AI agents.\n",

    "For this exercise we will create a **Superstore Agent** that is able to query the [Superstore Datasource](https://help.tableau.com/current/guides/get-started-tutorial/en-us/get-started-tutorial-connect.htm). This is convenient because this data source is available on every [Tableau Cloud](https://www.tableau.com/products/cloud-bi) or [Tableau Server](https://www.tableau.com/products/server) site by default and it also ships with every [Tableau Desktop](https://www.tableau.com/products/desktop) app.\n",
